- 👋 Hi, I’m @MeganCaitlinDallat
- 💻 I am a baby-programmer, currently working on completing my Masters in Software Development. (Java, PHP, MySQL, JSON, HTML, CSS, Basic Foundations of Computing Science).
- 👀 I’m interested in sea swimming 🏊‍♀️ , paddleboarding and gameboarding(?) (Reigning Catan-champ here).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning British Sign Language. I've completed Level one and I am very excited to continue learning and meeting more people from the Northern-Irish Deaf community 👐
- 💞️ I’m working on an absolute passion project at the moment. It is a communications app to help make interactions between those who do not know Sign Language and those who Sign easy. The idea is that it would make the world a little more accessible and hopefully encourage more people to join their local Sign Language classes and start learning!
